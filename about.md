Consisting of voters from the previous elections, the group was certain that they wanted to take a look at how disinformation on social media may have affected the outcome of the elections. As Twitter users, the proponents recalled a time of discourse surrounding Neri Colmenares. His campaign was marred by the red-tagging of his organizations, the proliferation of a fake resolution about his alleged disqualification, and eventually allegations of his own affiliation with the CPP-NPA-NDF. 

Despite not having a lot of experience in data science, the group set out to take a closer look at all the events that transpired, eventually narrowing it down to the aforementioned allegations on one of the most prominent figures of the Philippine opposition.
